Hello Guys Im Sajan Kumar Tak and This is My DockerFile Repository ...
In This Repository I Created fresher level Dockerfile...
# Dockerfile
Dockerfile is a text file thats contain instruction related for building a docker image.

# Dockerfile components:
ðŸ›  FROM: for base image, this command must be on the top of the dockerfile.
ðŸ›  WORKDIR: Specify the working directory inside the container.
ðŸ›  RUN: to execute commands, it will create a layer in image
ðŸ›  MAINTAINER: author/ owner/ description
ðŸ›  COPY: copy files from local system (docker vm) we need to provide source,
        destination (we canâ€™t download file from internet and any remote repo.)
ðŸ›  ADD: similar to copy but it provides a feature to download files from internet, also
        file at docker image side.
ðŸ›  EXPOSE: to expose ports such as port 8080 for tomcat , port 80 for nginx etc.
ðŸ›  CMD: execute commands but during container creation.
ðŸ›  ENTRYPOINT: similar to CMD but has higher priority over CMD, first
        commands will be executed by ENTRYPOINT only.
ðŸ›  ENV: environment variables

# After Creating This Docker File: build or tag image from this command :         #docker build . -t tagname/imagename:version
Create a file named Dockerfile
Add instructions in Dockerfile
Build dockerfile to create image
Run image to create container
